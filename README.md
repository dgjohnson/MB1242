The [MB1242](http://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB1242.htm) 
rangefinder from MaxBotix is an inexpensive I<sup>2</sup>C-based ultrasonic (sonar) sensor that can provide
distances between 20mm and 765mm.  Likes its UART-based MB1240 sibling, it is the sonar unit that MaxBotix
recommends for use on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.  Because I like to work with this sensor on both Arduino/Teensy
and RaspberryPi/ODROID, I wrote some little libraries that will allow you to use the MB1242 on either of these
platforms.

For more details, look in the folder (<b>arduino</b> or <b>wiringPi</b>) for your platform.
